= Functions

[quote, Robert C.Martin]

Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only.

'''

== Small!

Functions should

* be small.
* be smaller than that.
* contain no indentation whose level is greater than two.

== Do One Thing

Describe *steps* instead of things.

But _how_?

== One Level of Abstraction per Function

Use *The Stepdown Rule*.

=== The Stepdown Rule

Read the program as a set of _TO_ paragraphs.

For example,

[source, cpp]
----
----

A function should contain no _TO_ paragraph deeper than two levels.

Refactor the example above to

[source, cpp]
----
----
