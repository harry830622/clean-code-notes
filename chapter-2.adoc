= Meaningful Names

== Use Intention-Revealing Names

The name of a variable, function, or class should tell you

* why it exists.
* what is does.
* how it is used.

For example, comparing this one:

[source, cpp]
----
int enemies = 10; // Record the number of remaining enemies.
----

with this one:

[source, cpp]
----
int num_remaining_enemies = 10;
----

Obviously, the second one, which is expressive without a comment, is much
better.

== Avoid Disinformation

* Does it imply its type? +
  `pointVector` +
  => `std::vector<Point>` ?
* How to quickly spot their difference? +
  `NTUPlacerForEfficientPlacingOfMacros` +
  `NTUPlacerForEfficientRoutingOfMacros`
* WTF? +
  `if (O == l)` +
  `if (O == 1)` +
  `if (0 == l)` +
  `if (0 == 1)`

== Make Meaningful Distinctions

* Do not use number-series +
  `a1, a2, ..., aN`
* Do not add noise words +
  `Product` +
  `ProductInfo` +
  `ProductData`

== Use Pronounceable Names

== Use Searchable Names

== Avoid Encodings

== Avoid Metal Mapping

== Class Names

== Method Names
