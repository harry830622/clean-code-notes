# Comments

The proper use of comments is to compensate the **failure** to express ourselves in code.

---

## Comments do NOT make up for bad code

If you find your code a mess, **clean it** instead of adding comments!

## Explain yourself in code

```cpp
std::string str;

if (str.find('a') != std::string:npos)

// Much better
if (str.includes('a'))
```

## Good comments
